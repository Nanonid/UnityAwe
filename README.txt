UnityAwe is a simple drag-and-drop C# script for using Awesomium in Unity. Simply add RenderToTexture.cs to your assets folder and drag the script onto
any game object or GUI texture. 

Be sure to include AwesomiumMono's dll and dependencies (everything within the build/bin/release folder in the SDK) in the assets folder and in Unity's editor folder. 

Unity's Editor folder locations:
Windows = C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor
Mac = /Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/Frameworks
